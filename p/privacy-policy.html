                Your privacy is our priority. This website was built with a
                strong focus on simplicity and user privacy. Below, we clearly
                explain how we handle your data. <br><br>
                
                We do not collect, store, or share any personal information from users.
                There are no tracking tools, analytics, advertising technologies,
                or cookies in use. Your browsing remains anonymous and fully private.
                
                Notes you create can be saved locally in your browser using LocalStorage
                technology. This means your content stays entirely on your
                device and is never sent to our servers. You can delete your
                saved notes at any time—you have full control. <br><br>
                
                You also have the option to download your notes as files directly to your
                computer. This process happens entirely within your browser. No
                copies are transmitted to us or stored externally. <br><br>
                
                Because no data is transferred between your device and our servers, your
                privacy is naturally protected. That said, we recommend not
                using the site to store sensitive information such as passwords,
                banking details, or confidential personal data. How you use the
                site plays a role in your overall security. <br><br>
                
                We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally to reflect changes or improvements
                to our service. When we do, the updated date at the top of this
                page will change. We encourage you to check back from time to
                time to stay informed.
